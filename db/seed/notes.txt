AADL Fulfillment Stats Table Dump
as of Tuesday 9/24/2013
Containing 4 Million Holds Fulfilled since March 2010

Thanks for downloading this dataset!  These are records forcibly extracted from AADL's Integrated Library System (ILS), called Innovative Millennium, which is a big black box that runs the library circulation process.  We are exploring open source ILS alternatives, but for now, we're using this staid but stable product that has some blemishes that would make any Hacker blush in sympathetic embarrassment.  You'll see some of those in this dataset.  But for now, here are details on what this file contains and what its contents mean.

Requests are when a library user requests that an item be retrieved from the shelf at any of AADL's 5 locations, and sent to their desired pickup location at any one of AADL's 5 locations.  If no copies are available, their request will be queued in order received for the next available copy that is returned.  The data in this set is retrieved nightly from the ILS and a row is created for each request that was placed that day.  When the request is fulfilled, meaning when the item is placed on the hold shelf for pickup by the requester, the row is updated to show that the request has been filled.  This dataset contains no information about the requester or their pickup point.

The file contains about 4 Million rows, each with these fields in this order:

7-digit number: Bib record number.  The number of the title (bibliographic) record in AADL's catalog.  You can reach the web version of the catalog record for a given bib using this URL scheme: http://aadl.org/catalog/record/(bibnumber) and you can get a bit of machine-readable metadata for the item data via rss at http://aadl.org/cata/record/(bibnumber)?output=rss for example:

http://www.aadl.org/catalog/record/1388165

or

http://www.aadl.org/catalog/record/1388165?output=rss

Hexadecimal string: A hash of the user id.

Date: The date the request was placed. YYYY-MM-DD.

single letter: Material code, like book, dvd, bluray, cd, map, tool, etc.  Here's a table:

	a=BOOK                     
	b=BOOK ON TAPE             
	c=MUSIC SCORE              
	f=AV LANG STUDY            
	g=DVD                      
	i=BOOK ON CD               
	j=CD                       
	k=KIT                      
	l=LARGE TYPE               
	m=CD-ROM                   
	p=ART PRINT                
	r=TOOLS                    
	t=CASSETTE                 
	z=EBOOKS                   
	v=VHS                      
	s=MAGAZINE                 
	x=GRAPHIC NOVEL            
	u=BLU-RAY                  
	e=MAP                      
	n=NEWSPAPER                
	w=MICROFILM                
	y=WEBSITE                  
	q=STREAM 

Some of these are not requestable and will not show up in the dataset.

Date: Date the request was filled by the system, YYYY-MM-DD.  Null (\N) if the request is still outstanding.  If this date is present and the cancel status field (see below) is Null, that means the request was filled and placed on the holdshelf for pickup on that date.  If the fulfillment date is present and the cancel status field is not null, that means the request was canceled on that date.

Number: Number of copies of that title owned by AADL at the time the request was placed.  A value of 0 means that the request was placed before any AADL copies arrived.

Letter: Location of the request's pickup point:
	d: Downtown Library
	m: Malletts Creek Branch
	p: Pittsfield Branch
	t: Traverwood Branch
	w: West Branch

Text: Cancel Status Field.  In most rows, this will be Null.  That means the hold was filled normally and picked up.  There are a few other kinds of values for this field.  As mentioned above, if this field is not null, it contains the cancellation source, and the second date field on that row is the date of cancellation.  Here are the other known values of this field:

	clearholdshelf: this hold was cleared by the clearholdshelf report, meaning it was not picked up from the holdshelf by the patron during the 6-day pickup window and was cancelled and sent along to the next person, or back to the shelf.

	milacq*: cancelled by staff on the acquisitions team.  Usually items they called back for relabeling, or holds on items that never were shipped, etc.

	milcirc*: cancelled by staff in the circulation department.  Either because the patron requested in person or over the phone to cancel their request, or because the request cannot be filled (because the items are all missing or out of print, etc)

	milcat*: cancelled by staff on the cataloging team.  Usually because they're merging records and have re-created the requests on the new record.

	milmyselfcheck: cancelled by the requesting user at the selfcheckout stations.

	webpac*: cancelled by the requesting user over the web.

	You'll also notice that the IP address of the staff terminal is included for most of these.

That's what there is to know about this dataset!  Please enjoy and let us know what you do with the data or if you have any questions or ideas; you can reach me at eli@aadl.org .

Now go get a library card if you don't have one already so your requests can join these millions!
